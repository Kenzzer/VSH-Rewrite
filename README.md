# Versus Saxton Hale - Rewrite Edition
Versus Saxton Hale rewritten from scratch.

## Introduction
Versus Saxton Hale - Rewrite or simply VSH:Rewrite is a recreation of the original server mod Versus Saxton Hale (VSH) made by Eggman, released to the public on the 1st of February 2011. ([Post reference](http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=146884))

VSH:Rewrite entered its first alpha version on November 4th 2017, released for alpha & beta testing on [Red Sun Over Paradise](http://redsun.tf) and then published on [Dispenz0r's Fun Servers](dfs.tf) on December 24th 2018.

## Disclaimer

This server mod aims at offering a different experience from regular Freak Fortress 2 (FF2) servers and VSH servers. **Therefore any suggestions proposing to revert VSH:Rewrite to a gameplay closer to other FF2/VSH servers is to be ignored.**

## Compiling the mod
If you wish to compile VSH:Rewrite you will need to use our custom sourcemod plugin compiler. If you attempt to compile the mod with a regular sourcemod plugin compiler the output .smx file will not work on any sourcemod installations.

`spcomp`(Linux) & `spcomp_custom.exe`(Windows) are modified SM 1.9 plugin compiler.

`spcomp_custom_sm1.10.exe`(Windows) is an edited SM 1.10 plugin compiler.

The output .smx file from the custom compiler may be used on any sourcemod 1.9+ installation, It is **not** platform dependent and does **not** require a custom sourcemod.
## Installation
The assets pack is currently unavailable for public download due to unexpressed opinion with their rightful holders. We advise you don't use the server mod until we can publish the asset pack.
